# ECSE415-Project

The project report contains the written answers that we will submit, as well as a prototype of our algorithms. The code that does the real work will be in the `MIO-TCD-Classification-Code` and `MIO-TCD-Localization-Code` folders. Scripts that handle the parsing the image files and writing the result to csv are already there (from the website). We just need to call our classifier in the correct place.

In the two folders mentioned above are also csv files. `gt-train.csv` is the **G**round **T**ruth, and we will write our results into `your_results.csv`.
